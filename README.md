## 📋 Learning Module Overview

This learning module is organized into two focused sections to maximize your understanding:

### 📖 **Lesson: Conceptual Understanding**
**[Start the Lesson →](./lesson/README.md)**

Learn the theory and concepts behind the CSS Box Model:
- ✨ What the box model is and why it matters
- 🎯 The four layers: content, padding, border, and margin
- ⚙️ How `box-sizing` affects calculations
- 🎨 Visual examples and code demonstrations
- 🧠 Key principles for effective CSS layout

### 🧪 **Lab: Hands-On Practice**
**[Start the Labs →](./lab/README.md)**

Apply your knowledge through practical exercises:
- 🛠️ **Lab 1**: Create and style your first box
- 🎨 **Lab 2**: Experiment with different properties
- 🔍 **Lab 3**: Use Developer Tools for real-time inspection
- � **Challenges**: Test your understanding with practical scenarios

### Mockup
Below is a visual reference of how your Box Model Lab page could look:
![box-modal-mockup](/assets/box-model.png)

> **Guidelines**:  
> - The mockup is just a reference or a clue – you don’t need to - replicate it exactly.
> - Focus on demonstrating padding, border, margin, and box-sizing with your own style choices.
> - Try to make your layout organized and visually clear, but colors, spacing, and exact alignment can differ.
> - Use the mockup to inspire your design and help you understand how sections and boxes might be structured.


>**Note**: Think of it as a visual hint, not a strict template. **Creativity is encouraged!**
