# CSS Box Model Lab Project

A comprehensive educational project designed to teach CSS Box Model fundamentals through hands-on practice and visual demonstration.

## Project Overview

This project provides students with an interactive way to learn one of CSS's most fundamental concepts: the Box Model. Through building a visually distinct user profile card, students will understand how margin, border, padding, and content work together to create layouts.
